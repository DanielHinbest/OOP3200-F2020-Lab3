OOP 3200 Lab 3
This lab was a collaboration between Daniel Hinbest and Ryan Clayson in Object-Oriented Programming II (OOP 3200) at Durham College. The assignment was to build off of Labs 1 & 2, and create an ExtendedWorkTicket class that inherits from the WorkTicket and has a new isOpen attribute.
